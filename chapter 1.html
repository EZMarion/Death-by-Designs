  <h1>Chapter 1: The Introduction</h1>
  
  <p class="big-text">
    The world was silent.<br>
So silent, even the grass whispered. Each blade of grass swayed with the wind, its movement faint yet loud in the heavy quiet.
In the hollow of a bole, ancient tree, a small boy sat curled into himself. His knees drawn tight to his chest, stashing his dark curls head, his tiny hands covered over his ears, as though trying to block out something. He didn’t know how long he had been like that. Minutes? Hours? Days?
But something inside him stirred—some flickering bravery—and slowly,  he lifted his head.
The first thing he saw was… nothing.<br><br>
stretched far and wide. No voices. No footsteps. No birdsong. Only the wind.Tears stung his eyes. A raw, bloody cut mA sky, endless and gray, weighed down with heavy clouds. Beneath it, an ocean of green grass arked his left cheek, dried crimson flaking at the edges. His small chest rose and fell too quickly, but the emptiness in front of him gave him no answers. It felt wrong. All of it felt wrong.He couldn’t stay hidden anymore.<br><br>
With trembling limbs, he climbed out from the hollow and placed a hand on the coarse bark of the tree. Then he looked forward.
And his world changed.His tear-filled eyes went wide. The color drained from his face.<br>
He was not alone.<br>
Across the open field, scattered like broken dolls, lay others—people.<br>
But none of them were moving.<br>
None of them were breathing.<br>
They were all dead.<br><br>
Some of them were missing heads.<br>
Others had no legs—only torsos twisted unnaturally over the grass.<br>
There were at least thirty bodies, maybe more. Lifeless. Scattered. Broken.<br>
The boy froze, his breath caught somewhere between a scream and silence. His legs refused to move, but his eyes—wide and full of horror—locked onto one figure.<br>
It was her.<br>
His mother.<br>
Or, at least, half of her.<br>
Only her upper body remained. <br><br>
The boy’s heart pounded violently in his chest as he stumbled forward, limbs shaking, mouth open but wordless.<br>
Then—her eyes opened.<br>
And her hand reached out, grabbing his wrist with surprising strength.
He gasped, nearly falling backward. Her grip was cold, but alive. Her wrist was marked with something—an inked symbol etched into the skin. A tattoo, strange and sharp,
shaped like something not meant to be remembered. <br><br>

But he had same tattoo on his wrist too. Not only him, all of dead body had.<br>
“Run,” she whispered.<br>
And the world shattered.

He woke up choking on his own breath and lying on bed.<br>
Sweat soaked his skin, his chest rose and fell in ragged rhythm, but the only sound now was the gentle breeze sliding through the half-open window beside his bed. The sun was raising now.<br>
No blood. No grass. No bodies.<br>
But also—no mother.<br>
He sat up, elbows resting on his knees, hands covering his face.<br>
It had been twenty-three years.<br>
He was twenty-eight now, He called himself “Goth” but that moment—that field, that voice, that tattoo—still haunted him like it had happened yesterday.<br><br>
