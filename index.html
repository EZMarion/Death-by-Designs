    <h1>Death by Designs</h1>
    <p>This is my very first piece of writing and my own original novel, not a Translation. This novel is set in the 1900s and is especially suitable for those who enjoy detective stories, action, and mystery.</p>
    <p>When a high prince, a weary investigator, and a cold-eyed bounty hunter cross paths, they uncover a chilling truth buried beneath aristocratic lies, revenge, and forgotten justice.</p>
