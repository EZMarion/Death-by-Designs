      This is my very first piece of writing and my own original novel, not a translation. This novel is set in the 1900s and is especially suitable for those who enjoy decetive stories,action, and mystery. Kindly forgive me if I did anything wrong.When a high prince, a weary investigator, and a cold-eyed bounty hunter cross paths, they uncover a chilling truth buried beneath aristocratic lies, revenge, and forgotten justice. But the real terror is not the crimes themselves—it's who dares to carry them out, and why. </p>

   <p class="big-text">
       Hello, I'm a writer from Myanmar who has always been fascinated by the world of crime and mystery. Ever since I was young, I loved watching detective movies — the suspense, the secrets, and the thrill of uncovering the truth.
       As I grew older, my passion expanded to include mystery, thriller, and dark fantasy. I began creating my own characters and imagining twisted plots filled with hidden truths.
      "Death by Designs" is my very first novel — an original story born from my imagination. I’m excited to share my ideas and characters with you, and I hope you’ll enjoy walking into the dark, intriguing world I’ve built.
       Thank you for reading — and welcome to the mystery.</p>
